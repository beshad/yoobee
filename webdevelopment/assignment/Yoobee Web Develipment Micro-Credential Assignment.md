# Web Development Micro-credential Assignment

## Overview

The aim of the first part of this assignment is to apply the fundamentals of HTML and CSS to develop a multiple-page website. In this section of your  assignment, you will be coding a responsive website using HTML, CSS. 

The second part aims to apply the fundamentals of JavaScript to code a simple interactive application. In this part, you will be coding an interactive and functional code snippet using HTML and JavaScript. 

You will be marked on your application design, responsiveness, semantic HTML elements, valid CSS, functionality and error-free JavaScript code.

### WD01: HTML & CSS
- Minimum of three(3) web pages, pages must use proper document structure and organized, formatted and  intended. 
- Create an appropriate files and folders structure for your project.
- You can use any design of your choice to markup into HTML and style using CSS
- Typography, color, content, and image choice are left open-ended and subject to your decisions. Feel free to use placeholder content for images, text, paragraphs, etc.
- All pages must have navigation
- Write standards-compliant HTML markup and use semantic elements.
- Valid properly structured CSS, reusable classes, multiple-lined CSS with spaces and separation of content from style, ideally use BEM methodology for class names.
- Test all pages in multiple browsers: Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. Checks the HTML markup validity of your web documents ([The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)),
- Web pages must be responsive and mobile-friendly (CSS Media Queries, relative lengths, etc.)
- Extensive use of CSS display Grid and FlexBox for layout
- Usage of CSS preprocessor SCSS/SASS.
- Use of either CSS variables and/or SCSS variables.
- Use of pseudo-classes (i.e. `:hover`) and pseudo-elements (i.e.`::before`, `::after`)
- Project code is to be handed in as a GitHub repository
- Completed website must be published to Netlify
- At least two remote-based resources, i.e., inline frames (map, YouTube, etc.) and/or external CSS libraries (i.e., fonts, icons, NormalizeCSS etc.)
- You should make use of at least 3 meta-tags in the head section (i.e., keyword & description)

### WD02: JavaScript
The aim is to apply the fundamentals of JavaScript to develop the logic and interactivity to an HTML page.
- Create an HTML list using an unordered list element, a text-box with the placeholder “item,” and a button that says “Add.”
- Create a function. This function runs when the Add button is clicked and creates a new list element (`<li></li>`) containing the added value and appends it to the unordered list in our HTML document.
- Make sure that the content of the text box is cleared when the button is clicked so it’s ready for the next input from the user
- Code must be organized and explained using comments
