# *UX Design Micro Credential Assignment*

#### Overview
You will receive a client's business brief for this project, containing details about the client and their business needs. Your task involves researching and creating solution components that align with user requirements and the client’s objectives. Additionally, you'll develop wireframes and prototypes that align with the client's brief and user expectations.

The wireframe and prototype section of your assignment is focused on producing just a single platform digital solution, You can select between a mobile app design or a website redesign, but not both.

**You also have the option of using your own business brief.**

#### UX Design Micro-credential: UX01 UX Brief, Concepts & Research
It’s your job to conduct user research and produce a research report describing a solution that will meet target user requirements and satisfy the client brief.
##### Learning outcomes
• Demonstrate broad knowledge of a range of UX design standards, principles & concepts (1 credit).
• Select and apply a range of functional specifications in a design brief considering business objectives and user requirements (2 credits).

#### UX Design Micro-credential: UX02 Wireframe, Prototype & Test
It’s your job to design wireframes and produce interactive prototypes to satisfy the client brief and end-user needs, then perform user testing to identify usability issues.
##### Learning outcomes
- Select and apply a range of wireframing, functional prototyping and interactive techniques in developing a solution to a UX design brief (2 credits).
- Demonstrate knowledge of prototyping, usability testing, analysis, and reporting (2 credits)

#### Requirements

- Produce a UX Design brief
- For your initial user studies, prepare a list of relevant interview questions.  Document these questions and include them in your deliverables.
- Conduct research and perform the initial interviews with the target audiences (1 to 3 participants)
- Produce an empathy map.
- Develop a user persona. Persona should include user demographic, their motivators, behaviors, needs and any specific requirements e.g. accessibility needs.
- Develop one Customer Journey Map that defines the steps and process taken by your persona to meet their goal. Draw this up as a timeline, including changes in motivations, problems, emotions and needs along the way.
- Produce a UX User Flow Diagram that outlines the steps the user must take when using your solution in order to meet their goal.
- Produce a simple UX Sitemap that defines the hierarchy and information structure of your solution (hint:using card sorting technique). The map should be organised into screens or pages and indicates how the user transitions between sections.
- Develop (Miro) wireframes. you can also use your wireframes as wire-flow and/or sitemap.
- Develop (Figma) low-fidelity or mid-fidelity interactive prototypes. Review the end user and business requirements to ensure your prototypes include all the relevant and specified components.
- Conduct usability testing on your solution and produce a user testing report
