### Name
Eco-Friendly Marketplace UX Project

### About our company
We are an online marketplace that sells eco-friendly and sustainable products such as reusable straws, bamboo toothbrushes, and eco-friendly cleaning supplies. We have been in business for 2 years and have a customer base of 10,000+ people.

### What do we need
We need a complete redesign of our website to improve the user experience and increase sales.

### Why do we need it
Our current website is not user-friendly and has a high bounce rate. We want to improve the design and functionality of the website to make it easier for customers to find and purchase the products they need. Additionally, we want to improve our branding and messaging to appeal to a wider audience.

### Our vision for the project
We want to create a website that is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and provides a seamless shopping experience for customers. We want to showcase our commitment to sustainability and eco-friendliness through the design and messaging of the website. Our ideal website will be modern, clean, and minimalist. We are open to incorporating illustrations and other design elements to achieve this.

### Where will the UX design be used
The UX design will be used on our website, which is built on the Shopify platform.

### What file types are required
PDF or PNG files are preferred, however wireframes and prototypes can be delivered by Figma or Miro URLs too.

### Target audience
Our target audience includes people who are environmentally conscious and are looking for eco-friendly and sustainable alternatives to everyday products. Our typical customers are aged 25-45, have a higher education level, and have disposable income.

### Deadline
We’d like the UX design completed within the next 2 months.

### Budget
NZD8000

### Point of contact
You’ll be working with our Marketing Manager, Sarah, and our Senior Designer, Mark.
