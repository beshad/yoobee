#### Name

Vinyless company UX project

---

#### About our company

My name is John, and I’m the founder and owner of Vinyless – a digital music, podcast, and video service enabling users to stream their favorite audio, as well as upload and share their own. We have been running for 3 years and have over 300,000+ users.

---

#### What do we need
We need a new mobile app and website redesign

---

#### Why do we need it

We’re looking to quickly grow the business, and the current website design isn’t performing as well as we’d like. a new mobile app and a redesigned website will help increase brand awareness and push us to become key contenders in the digital audio space.

---

#### Our vision for the project

Our product currently runs mainly online (website), but we’d also like to expand this to the mobile app too. As our target industry is highly saturated, we’d like our brand to stand out from the rest – we’re not afraid to push boundaries!
Our current brand assets have a more corporate feel, but we’d like to update them and create something more trendy to fit in with our target market. With the company name being Vinyless, we’d like to include playful elements featuring vinyl, retro, vintage or other audio products.
Here are few examples of styles we like:
