#### WD02: Javascript
The aim is to apply the fundamentals of JavaScript to develop the logic and interactivity to an HTML page.
- Create a HTML list using an unordered list element, a text-box with the placeholder “item”, and a button that says “Add.”
- Create a function. This function runs when the Add button is clicked and creates a new list element (`<li></li>`) containing the added value and appends it to the unordered list in our HTML document. 
- Make sure that the content of the text box is cleared when the button is clicked so it’s ready for next input from the user
- Code must be organized and explained using comments
