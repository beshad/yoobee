# What are HTML, CSS & JavaScript?
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three fundamental technologies used to create web pages and web applications:

> **HTML** is a markup language used to structure the content of web pages. It defines the elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and other media. HTML provides a standardized way to describe the content of a web page, making it accessible to browsers and search engines.

> **CSS** is a style sheet language used to control the presentation of web pages. It allows web designers to define the visual style of HTML elements, including layout, typography, color, and other visual properties. By separating the presentation layer from the content layer, CSS makes it easier to create consistent and visually appealing web pages.

> **JavaScript** is a scripting language used to create dynamic web pages and interactive user interfaces. It allows web developers to add interactivity, animation, and other advanced features to web pages. JavaScript code can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS elements, respond to user events, interact with web APIs, and more.

While HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are often used together to create web pages, **they serve distinct purposes and should be kept separate**. HTML defines the content and structure of a web page, CSS defines its presentation and style, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the page.
